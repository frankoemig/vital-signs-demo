# vital-signs-demo

This is Demo IG for **cross-paradigm cross-country specifications** (using some vital signs as examples).

In order to demonstrate it, the following artifacts are used as an example:

* blood pressure
* body weight
* body height

This guide tries to document a different approach in writing implementation guides. 
It starts with a mindmap to collect necessary details, continues with an information model
to document the relationship between different items, and derives technical representations
that are then transfered into different data exchange standards like FHIR, CDA and v2.x.
