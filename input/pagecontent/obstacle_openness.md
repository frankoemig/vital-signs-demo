This obstacle discusses the openness of profiles for vital signs.

### Background

Some profiles, esp. from the KBV, are closed in a way that the cardinality for all not needed attributes are set to "0".
That restricts the use to very specific use cases, but it prevents from reusing it for other and therefore
requires reimplementation.

### Proposal

Keep all attributes optional and include the proper context.
